#How to use
```
1)First you need to select one of the episodes.
2)Then you get all the content from this episode and put under the root
3)Run $ php -S localhost:8000 "or what ever port you want to use"
4)Should be working in "http://localhost:8000" if not check the port you created the server.(or if it's a bug xD)
```
